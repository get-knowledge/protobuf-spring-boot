1. gRPC is a modern open source framework to implement microservices in an efficient way to build high performance and highly    scalable applications.

2. gRPC uses Protocol Buffers as data format for exchange of messages between microservices unlike REST API with JSON.

3. gRPC enables pluggable support for authentication, load balancing, health checking and tracing. Uses HTTP/2 protocol to transport the data so allows bi-directional communication between microservices

4. This framework is developed by Google and made it as opensource.

5. This is a next generation framework that will overtake REST APIs / RESTful architecture in near future. 

6. And also you will learn how grpc is better than rest.

This gRPC intro tutorial gives better understanding of how to implement microservices using gRPC and protobuf
